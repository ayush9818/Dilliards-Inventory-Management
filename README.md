  1. Subsampled 1% data from Transact.csv and Skuinfo.csv files using Python for exploratory purposes as the original files were too large to load in Python or R.
  2. There were some issues in matching column names from DBSchema and CSV data in Transact.csv and Skuinfo.csv. Tried fixing those issues by refering to column names description. Still few column names are left due to similar values.
